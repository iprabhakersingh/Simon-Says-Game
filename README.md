# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A fun memory-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The goal is simple: follow and repeat the sequence of colors that light up — but it gets harder with every round!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Press the **Start** button (or any key, if enabled)
2. Watch the pattern as buttons flash
3. Click the buttons in the **same order**
4. Each correct round increases the sequence length
5. One wrong click → Game Over ❌  
   Try again to beat your previous score!
